# My First Web Project On Github
## Odin Recipes

Hi, welcome to my first ever web project on Github, made as an assignment for The Odin Project. Free advertising for TOP, yay! :space_invader:

At the time of writing (end of 2022), this project would be showcasing skils like *Git*, *Github*, and *HTML*. However, further down the line, it might include *CSS*, *JS* and who knows, maybe some **fancy frameworks** and **tech stack** like *MEAN*. :smiley:
